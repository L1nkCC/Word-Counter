<div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Programming Assignment:  Word Counter</h1></div>
<h2>1. The problem</h2>
<p>
You have been hired by Grate Books Publishing to help authors with their prose.
You are supposed to warn authors if they use words too frequently.  Authors give
you a document as an ordinary text file.  You have to collect the words of the
file (case is significant; discard punctuation and spacing; only use letters A-Z
and a-z and underscore '_') and print two
outputs.  Both outputs list all the words and the number of times they appear,
one word per line, no word duplicated.  For example, you might print
</p><pre>dark 1
stormy 1
night 4
the 18
they 2
</pre>
The first output should be sorted by word (in ASCII alphabetical order), the
second by number of occurrences (in reverse numerical order; ties may be in any
order).
<h2>2. What to do</h2>
<p>
Your program should be called wordCount.  It should accept the text file from
standard input.
The output must obey the following specifications.
Output both lists to standard output, with a single blank line
between the lists, and no other information (such as headings).
Each line holds a single word and its count, separated by a single space.
</p><p>
You must use a hash table to store the counts.
You may use any hash function and any collision-resolution scheme you wish.
</p><p>
You must write your own sorting algorithm to sort the output and your own
hash-table routines.  (You may not use any library routines for sorting or
hashing.)
You will lose 2 points if you use selection sort or insertion sort;
you will get full credit for heapsort, merge sort, or quicksort.
You may not use any other sorting method.
</p><h2>Useful tools</h2>
<p>
You have access to some useful tools.  First, there is a sample
<code>Makefile</code> at
<code><a href="http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/courses/CS315/prog4/Makefile">http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/courses/CS315/prog4/Makefile</a></code>.
It has a <i>run</i> target that compiles your program (either <code>wordCount.c</code> or
<code>wordCount.cpp</code>) and runs it.  It also has a <i>runWorking</i> target that gets and
runs a working program so you can compare your output against it.
</p><p>
</p><h2>3. What to hand in</h2>
<p>
Your submission should include your program, all documentation,
your program's output on the data in
<code><a href="http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/courses/CS315/prog4/data.txt">http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/courses/CS315/prog4/data.txt</a></code>,
your own test data, and your program's output on that test data.
</p><h2>4. Extra credit ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>

Implement heapsort, merge sort, and quicksort and measure the number of data
motions and comparisons each requires.
(Maximum 0.5 extra-credit points)
</li><li>

Suppress very common words such as <i>the</i> from consideration by
referring to a separate hash table of "stop" words.
(Maximum 0.3 extra-credit points)
</li><li>

Implement several collision-resolution schemes and measure the number of key
comparisons your program uses for each.
(Maximum 0.5 extra-credit points)
