Discription(main): The program take in input from stdout, counts the occurances of words, 
	and prints them bothe by ascii and by occurance


const:
	char PUNC[]: all characters to be removed from inputs
	int PUNCLEN: value of the length of PUNC



struct hashNode:
	holds a word and how many times it has been inputted



func makeNode:
	returns a node with the given word

func hashValue:
	calculates a hash Value for a given word

func partitionOnWord:
	partitions list for QuickSort on hashNode.word

func quickSortOnWord:
	quicksorts list on hashNode.word

func sortOnWord:
	calls quickSortOnWord for entire list

func partitionOnAmount:
	partitions List for QuickSort on hashNode.amount

func quickSortOnAmount:
	quicksorts list on hashNode.amount

func sortOnAmount:
	calls quickSortOnAmount for entire list

func addOne:
	find node with .word equal to given key and add one to its amount and return 1
	if not found return -1

func endPunClean:
	return -1 if string is empty
	remove characters in PUNC from front and back of given string and return 1

func middlePuncClean:
	ONLY USEFUL AFTER CALL TO endPuncClean();
	break apart string into words seperated by chars in PUNC and add them to given list

func print:
	prints the value of hashNodes in a vector<hashNode>
